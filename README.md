# Portfolio Projects

Here are many small and large projects written in Python, R, SQL or Bash, in hopes to demonstrate my proficiency in programming, data science and data analysis. The project number at the beginning of each name, demonstrates its simplicity:  
  - The smaller the number, the more simplistic the project.
  - The higher the number, the more complex the project.  

If data (.csv, .json, .txt, etc...) is needed for any of the projects, please refer to the **Data** folder.
