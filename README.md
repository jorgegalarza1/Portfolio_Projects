# Portfolio Projects

Large and small projects in Python, R, SQL or Bash in hopes to demonstrate my programming, data analysis and data science proficiency.  

The project number at the beginning of each name, demonstrates its simplicity:  
  - The smaller the number, the more simplistic the project.
  - The higher the number, the more complex the project.  

If data (.csv, .json, .txt, etc...) is needed for any of the projects, please refer to the [**Data**](https://github.com/jorgegalarza1/Portfolio_Projects/tree/main/Data) folder.
